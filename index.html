					<h1>Mushroom Hunting in Middle Tennessee</h1>
					<article id="intro">	
						<h3>Not for the Faint of Heart</h3>
						<p>In the world of foraging, few organisms conjure up more fear and mystery than mushrooms.  Tell someone you harvest wild berries, and he thinks to himself what a great hobby.  Tell another person you hunt wild mushrooms, and she fears for your life.</p>
						<p>The fungal kingdom, it seems, is a bit of an enigma.  In 1991, a paper was published suggesting that, although 1.5 million fungi were thought to have inhabited the earth, only about 70,000, or 4.7%, of fungal organisms were identified at that time (1).  Today, it is estimated that there are 5.1 million fungal species in existence, and the number of identified species is still quite small in comparison.</p>

						<h3>Morels in Tennessee</h3>
						<p>Few mushrooms in the wild resemble morels, and the ones that do can be easily distinguished based on key defining features.  The yellow morel, for instance, retains a hollow and pitted head.  Likewise, a cross-section of the stalk typically reveals a hollow interior.  Additionally, the cap is attached to the stalk.</p>
						<p>Look for morels in old apple orchards or in burned areas.  They’re also associated with tulip poplar, ash, beech, maple, and dead or dying elm trees.  In the eastern United States, they can be found in the spring months through early summer.</p>

						<h3>The Unmistakable Lion's Mane Mushroom</h3>
						<p>Not all mushrooms look like the portobellos and the shiitakes found in the grocery store.  Lion’s mane, for one, certainly does not.  It is one of the most unique-looking mushrooms, with its unbranched body of icicle-like spines and soft white tissue.  Accordingly, lion’s mane is a great mushroom for beginning mushroom hunters.</p>
						<p>Also known as the pom-pom mushroom, lion’s mane is one of the most delectable mushrooms in the fungal kingdom, resembling crab meat in taste and texture.  Additionally, lion’s mane has been well researched for its role in improving cognitive health, producing neuro-regenerative effects in numerous studies. Look for lion’s mane on the wounds of living hardwood trees, such as oaks and maples, as well as on recently felled trees.  It can be found in the summer months through autumn.</p>

						<h3>The Bright and Meaty Chicken of the Woods</h3>
						<p>Chicken of the woods (chicken mushroom, sulphur shelf) grows in clusters on both standing and downed trees, emerging as knob-like growths and soon developing into numerous shelves.  The color is an unmistakable yellowish-orange, and the pore surface is yellow (for L. sulphureus, and white for the closely related L. cincinnatus … both edible).  Always make sure the underside has pores.  If it has gills, you won’t be having chicken for dinner.</p>
						<p>The chicken mushroom resembles … get this … chicken in taste and texture, and is best collected when young.  As it ages, the chicken mushroom becomes too tough to eat, though the outer edges can still be salvaged and used in dishes.  Like all wild mushrooms, it requires cooking before consumption.</p>

						<h3>The Trickier Maitake</h3>
						<p>The maitake mushroom (sheep’s head, hen-of-the-woods) is a choice edible and medicinal that always demands a good hunt.  While it’s easy to identify and widely distributed, the maitake mushroom can be somewhat tricky to locate compared to the showy chicken mushroom, as the former blends in well with the autumnal foliage.  Maitake contains overlapping gray to brown caps attached to a single base.  Individual specimens can be rather large and weigh several pounds.  Like other polypores (mushroom fruiting bodies with pores or tubes on the underside), maitake has no gills.</p>
						<p>Maitake compliments a variety of dishes, lending a hearty flavor and tender texture.  In addition to its use as a food, maitake has been researched extensively for its medicinal properties, specifically in the areas of cancer and diabetes.</p>
